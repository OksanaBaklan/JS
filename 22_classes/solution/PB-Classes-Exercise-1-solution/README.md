# JS Classes

Check out the class in `index.js`

It already contains the properties `firstname` and `lastname`

## 1. Full name

Create the instance property `fullname` and `email` in the `Employee` class. Given a person's first and last name:

Form `fullname` by simply joining the first and last name together, separated by a single space.

## 2. Email
Create the instance property `email` in the `Employee` class. Given a person's first and last name:

Form `email` by joining the first and last name together with a `.` in between, and follow it with `@company.com` at the end. Make sure the entire email is in lowercase.

## Examples

```
emp1 = new Employee("John", "Smith")
emp1.fullname ➞ "John Smith"

emp2 = new Employee("Mary",  "Sue")
emp2.email ➞ "mary.sue@company.com"

emp3 = new Employee("Antony", "Walker")
emp3.firstname ➞ "Antony"
