    Whenever we need to solve a problem is a good idea to analyze it first and then code.
    For that purpose is very useful to write down an algorithm.

    An algorithm describes the actions that need to be taken in order to solve a certain problem.
    It is written in plain english.

    Example..preparing tea

    1 - gather everything we need;
    2 - plug in kettle;
    3 - put teabag in a cup;
    4 - pour water into the kettle
    5 - wait for kettle to boil;
    6 - Add hot water to cup;
    7 - Remove teabag with spoon/fork;
    8 - Add milk or sugar;
    9 - Serve;

    Pseudocode
