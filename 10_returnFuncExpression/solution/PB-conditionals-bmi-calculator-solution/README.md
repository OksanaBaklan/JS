# Programming Basics: BMI Calculator
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: `BMI = mass / (height * height)`. (mass in kg, i.e. 72.5, and height in meters, i.e. 1.65).

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in the variables `markHeight`, `markMass`, `johnHeight`, `johnMass`.
2. Calculate both their BMIs and store the values in the variables `markBMI`, `johnBMI`. 
3. Create the boolean variable `markMoreBeefCake` containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
4. Print a string to the console containing the variable from task 3 using string interpolation. (e.g. "Q4: Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? Why yes, it's [boolean], it is") please add "Q4:" at the beginning of the logged text. 
5. Create an *if* statement to print the name of the person with highest BMI and their BMI (fixed to two numbers after decimal) (e.g. "Q5: Mark xx.xx") please add "Q5:" at the beginning of the logged text.
