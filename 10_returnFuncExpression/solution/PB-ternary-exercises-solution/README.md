# Programming Basics: Ternary

These exercises are designed to make you more comfortable with the ternary operator. 

- write your code in  `solution.js`

1. Declare a boolean variable named `isDog`. Write code that prints a sentence to the console depending on the value of dog. If true, print 'pat, pat' and if not, print 'find me a dog to pat!'

2. Declare 2 variables named `speedLimit` and `yourSpeed`. Assign speedLimit to 50km/h. If yourSpeed is above that, this sentence 'you're going too fast!' should be printed. If speed is lower than speedLimit, this sentence 'You're driving below the speed limit, Oma' should be printed.

3. Declare a variable named `age`.  Write code that prints a sentence to the console depending on the age value. If age is below 16, "serve butter beer" should be printed. Otherwise "serve beer".

4. Declare a variable named `isStudent`. Write code that prints a sentence to the console depending on the variable's valuue. If true, "Ticket costs €5,00" should be printed. If false, "Ticket costs €12,00".

5. Declare a variable named `okMarie`. write code that checks if the value of the variable is 'cake' - if so, "Let them eat cake" should be printed. If not, "Oh, bother". 

6. Check if the following numbers are even numbers. Use a ternary and if the number is even e.g. `30`. `30 is even` should be printed, else e.g. `31`: `31 is odd`
* num1 = 30
* num2 = 939
* num3 = 40.9
