/*
Ex 5
Create an object called "myDay" that contains 2 properties:
    - arrDays (an array containing the days of the week in word)
    - arrActivities (an empty array)

    and 2 methods:
    dayOfTheWeek - (using the date object you will have to extract the current day of the week in words! Tip: Use the arrDays as well!)
                    You will have to RETURN the day of the week. 
    addActivities - this method takes an array as an argument and will print the following 
                    "Today is Monday and these are my activities ðŸ˜´,ðŸ‘• "

Once you are done, call the addActivities method (outside the obj) and pass an array with some emojis.. you can find them here https://getemoji.com/
Make sure you wrap the emojis in quotes.       
Example             
myDay.addActivities( ['ðŸ˜´','ðŸ‘•'] );
